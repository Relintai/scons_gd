==================================================================

A new SCons release, 4.4.1, is now available on the SCons download page:

    https://scons.org/pages/download.html


Here is a summary of the changes since 4.4.0:

NEW FUNCTIONALITY
-----------------

- Added ValidateOptions() which will check that all command line options are in either
  those specified by SCons itself, or by AddOption() in SConstruct/SConscript.  It should
  not be called until all AddOption() calls are completed. Resolves Issue #4187

DEPRECATED FUNCTIONALITY
------------------------

- List anything that's been deprecated since the last release

CHANGED/ENHANCED EXISTING FUNCTIONALITY
---------------------------------------

- Added -fsanitize support to ParseFlags().  This will propagate to CCFLAGS and LINKFLAGS.
- Calling EnsureSConsVersion() and EnsurePythonVersion() won't initialize
  DefaultEnvironment anymore.
- The console message from the Chmod() action function now displays
  octal modes using the modern Python syntax (0o755 rather than 0755).

FIXES
-----

- List fixes of outright bugs

- Added missing newline to generated compilation database (compile_commands.json)
- A list argument as the source to the Copy() action function is now handled.
  Both the implementation and the strfunction which prints the progress
  message were adjusted.

IMPROVEMENTS
------------

- List improvements that wouldn't be visible to the user in the
  documentation:  performance improvements (describe the circumstances
  under which they would be observed), or major code cleanups

PACKAGING
---------

- List changes in the way SCons is packaged and/or released

- SCons now has three requirements files: requirements.txt describes
  requirements to run scons; requirements-dev.txt requirements to
  develop it - mainly things needed to run the testsuite;
  requirements_pkg.txt are the requirements to do a full build
  (including docs build) with an intent to create the packages.

DOCUMENTATION
-------------

- List any significant changes to the documentation (not individual
  typo fixes, even if they're mentioned in src/CHANGES.txt to give
  the contributor credit)

- Updated the --hash-format manpage entry.
- EnsureSConsVersion, EnsurePythonVersion, Exit, GetLaunchDir and
  SConscriptChdir are now listed as Global functions only.
- Updated the docs for Glob.
- Updated SHELL_ENV_GENERATORS description and added versionadded indicator.

DEVELOPMENT
-----------

- Refactored SCons/Taskmaster into a package. Moved SCons/Jobs.py into that package.
  NOTE: If you hook into SCons.Jobs, you'll have to change that to use SCons.Taskmaster.Jobs
